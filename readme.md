# Py3D Game Demo
> 3D game made in Python somehow... all made by AI. Expect it to be a beta for a very long time because AI sucks.

## Controls
- WASD to move
- Space to attack
- H to spawn an enemy

> [!NOTE]
> The enemy texture is from my unreleased and unfinished game called "Jodie's Encouragement" which sounded like a good idea at the time until realizing that it was a bad idea to make a SkateBIRD fangame for some reason. Maybe this'll become the SkateBIRD fangame I never made?
