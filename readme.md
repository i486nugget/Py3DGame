# SkatePy
> 3D skatebourding game made in Python somehow... all made by AI. Expect it to be a beta for a very long time because AI sucks.

## Controls
- A/D to steer
- Up/Down/Left/Right to look around
- Space to ollie
- P to play hidden track (not really hidden since you can read this lol)

> This is a SkateBIRD fangame. You can support the developers [here](https://www.glassbottomgames.com).
